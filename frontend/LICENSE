                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
                       
Copyright (C) [2025] [TGI POS]
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble
                            
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom (this is
about freedom, not price) and this GPL aims to make sure that software
is free.

[The standard GPL v3 text continues here. Please include the complete text
from the official GNU GPL v3 license (available at https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)
until you reach the section before “How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs”.]

---------------------------------------------------------
              ADDITIONAL ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT
---------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3, the
following additional requirement is imposed on all recipients of this 
Software or derivative works thereof:

   Attribution. All modified or unmodified redistributions of this 
   Software, in source or binary form, must include prominent credit 
   to the original developers and to the organization "augusthost".

   This credit must be visible in any documentation, "About" screens, or 
   other collateral materials accompanying the distributed software, in a 
   manner that is reasonably appropriate to the medium in which such 
   distribution is made.

   For example, an attribution notice stating:

       "TGI POS is originally developed by [August Host Developers] and maintained by augusthost."

   must be included. The exact format of such attribution may be chosen suitably 
   by the distributor but must not be removable by end users without deliberate 
   action to re-establish it.

             END OF ADDITIONAL TERMS
---------------------------------------------------------

[Insert the remaining official text of GNU GPL v3 here, including all sections after
the point above through the “How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs” section.]

                        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
---------------------------------------------------------

If you develop a new program and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software that 
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
