## Inspiration

The idea for TGI Offline POS was born out of the need for a reliable, offline-capable point-of-sale system that doesn't rely on constant internet connectivity. We wanted to combine the best of modern web technologies with the stability of a desktop application to create a comprehensive solution for retail and service businesses.
